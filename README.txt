This UI requires the following GWT libraries: 
	* gwt-dnd (Drag-and-Drop, available from http://code.google.com/p/gwt-dnd/, Apache 2.0 License)
	* gwt-fx (Native visual effects, available from http://code.google.com/p/gwt-fx/, Apache 2.0 License)
	 
The UI takes a GET parameter of the form &json_src= that specifies where to pull the data from, relative to the app itself.
